## About the Challenge 💡
The **100 Days of Coding Challenge** is a commitment to code for at least 1 hour every day for 100 days. The goal is to:
- Build consistent coding habits.
- Learn new technologies and frameworks.
- Create a portfolio of projects.
- Improve problem-solving and programming skills.

This repository serves as a log of my daily progress, including code snippets, project descriptions, and lessons learned.

---

## Rules 📜
1. **Code for at least 1 hour every day.**
2. **Document your progress daily** (e.g., commit to GitHub, write a log).
3. **Build projects** instead of just passively learning.
4. **Share your journey** on social media or with friends for accountability.
5. **Stay consistent**—even if it's just a small step, keep moving forward!
